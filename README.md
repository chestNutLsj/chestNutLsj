- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chestNutLsj, a student from China, majoring in IoT&Sec at Xidian University, the City of Xi'An, China.
- ðŸ˜Š Now, I am studying hard and look forward to passing the postgraduate entrance exam to be admitted by Tsinghua. (But it is so hard after infected with covid-19 and maybe I will try again in 2023.)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the frontiers of tech and other science (besides cs, such as physics, chemistry, and etc.)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning and rust and I love to study extensively. After I pass the postgraduate exam, I will reading *The Feynman's Lectures on Physics*, *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information*, *Das Kapital* (know the world and its running rules in the perspective of a Marxist), and so on.
- ðŸ“« If you want to study together with me and talk about knowledge of computer science and technology, please contact me in the way as follows:
